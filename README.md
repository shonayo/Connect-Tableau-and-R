This repository contains documentation of how to connect tableau and R. It also contains python project "Predicting Hotel Rating Based on User Reviews". Online user reviews are instrumental in helping users to decide which hotel to book for their stay at their choice of location. Online user reviews help potential customers to understand the positive and negative aspects of a hotel. It also allows users to learn about the amenities provided by the hotel. User reviews are not only useful for potential customers, but also help the management to understand the areas at which the hotel needs to improve. This will allow the management to take appropriate steps and ultimately improve the reputation of the hotel. TripAdvisor is a website that contains a number of user reviews for multiple hotels across the globe. Each user leaves a brief review about the hotel, and rates the hotel based on multiple factors like value, location, sleep quality, cleanliness and service. Based on the user reviews and their ratings, each hotel is given an overall rating on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
